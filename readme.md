## Dragg and Drop

 This is an app (sample) for drag and drop items in list, with ability to delete or add new items. It is all based on AJAX (jqurey), and jqueryUI (for sorting)

 You need a database with table "items". Please check (or import) items.sql dump for test data.

 This project is build on lumen framework (laravel subset). So you shoul be familliare with it.

 You should follow this guide to install lumen, and than to edit your .env file

 After installing lumen, and everything else, you should change your database credentials in .env , this is how mine looks:
 DB_CONNECTION=mysql
 DB_HOST=localhost
 DB_DATABASE=draggable
 DB_USERNAME=homestead
 DB_PASSWORD=secret
